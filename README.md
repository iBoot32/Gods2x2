# Gods2x2
A program to brute-force a solution to your 2x2 cube, potentially using ZERO ALGORITHMS!

This program first brute-forces a solution to the first layer of the 2x2 cube.
From there, it permutes the top corners using a single commutator. If necessary, the program will apply a singular algorithm to fix the back two corners on the top.
Then, the program orients the top corners using a single commutator, solving the cube.

~~~

The goal of this project was the solve a 2x2 cube using the least amount of algorithms as we can, instead relying on brute-force whenever possible, only resorting to commutators and (at worst) a singular algorithm when absolutely necessary.

Contrary to what you'd might think, this program can solve a 2x2 cube reasonably fast (considering its inherent slowness as a result of its reliance on brute-force).
However if you're looking for speed, check out my more efficent algorithm, CubeBot2.0.

Enjoy,
